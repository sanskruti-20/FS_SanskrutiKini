Problem statement - Student Commute Optimizer

# üéì Student Commute Optimizer

##  Problem Definition
Many students commute individually to the same school or college, often traveling along overlapping or similar routes.  
This results in:
- Higher **travel costs** (fuel, tickets, etc.)
- **Traffic congestion** and parking problems near campuses
- Increased **carbon emissions** from multiple vehicles
- Missed opportunities for **social connections**

The **Student Commute Optimizer** is designed to solve this problem by:
- Allowing students to enter their **home location and destination**
- Detecting **overlapping or nearby travel routes**
- Suggesting **carpool or ride-sharing matches**
- Providing an in-app **anonymous chat system** using unique aliases

---

##  Benefits to Students
-  Cost Savings** ‚Äì Share rides and reduce daily commuting expenses  
-  Convenience** ‚Äì Optimized route matches reduce stress and parking issues  
-  Eco-Friendly** ‚Äì Fewer vehicles mean lower carbon footprint and traffic congestion  
-  Safety & Privacy** ‚Äì Students remain anonymous through unique aliases until they choose to share more  
-  Community Building** ‚Äì Encourages peer connections and social bonding during commutes  

---

## Technology Stack

Since this is a **full-stack project**, the following technologies can be used:

### Frontend (Student-facing)
- **React.js** (Web) or **React Native** (Mobile) ‚Äì modern, responsive user interface  
- **Mapbox GL / Leaflet.js** ‚Äì interactive maps, routes, and nearby students  
- **Tailwind CSS / Material UI** ‚Äì clean and responsive UI design  
- **Socket.IO (client)** ‚Äì real-time chat and updates  

---

### Backend (System operations)
- **Node.js (Express / Fastify)** or **Python (FastAPI / Django REST)** ‚Äì REST APIs and WebSocket endpoints  
- **Socket.IO (server)** ‚Äì for chat and live event communication  
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** ‚Äì relational database with geospatial queries for route matching  
- **Redis** ‚Äì caching, session management, and quick geo lookups  
- **Routing Engine** ‚Äì OSRM (self-hosted) or Mapbox/Google Directions API for route calculations  

---

### Authentication & Privacy
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** ‚Äì secure login/session handling  
- **Unique Alias Service** ‚Äì ensures anonymous, unique usernames for students  

---

### Deployment & DevOps
- **Docker & Docker Compose** ‚Äì containerized microservices  
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** ‚Äì orchestration and scalability (future phase)  
- **NGINX / API Gateway** ‚Äì reverse proxy, load balancing, SSL termination  
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** ‚Äì automated build, test, and deploy pipeline  
- **Cloud Options** ‚Äì AWS (RDS for Postgres, Elasticache for Redis, EKS for K8s), GCP, or Heroku for MVP  

---

### Optional Enhancements
- **Push Notifications** ‚Äì Firebase Cloud Messaging (for mobile alerts)  
- **User Verification** ‚Äì email/OTP login for secure onboarding
